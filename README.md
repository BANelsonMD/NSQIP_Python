From the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) website (https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/data-and-registries/acs-nsqip/participant-use-data-file/):

  "The Participant Use Data File (PUF) is a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant data file containing cases submitted to the American College of   Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement ProgramÂ®.

  The 2023 PUF contains 994,313 cases submitted from 676 NSQIP-participating sites. Seventeen other separate NSQIP PUFs, containing a rich database of more than 11.6 million       cases, are also available. Only cases included in corresponding Semiannual Report (SAR) risk-adjustment calculations are in the PUF datasets. For background information on the   case inclusion/exclusion criteria and the data collection and submission processes, please visit the ACS NSQIP Program Specific page. Variable formats, variable definitions     (which can change from year to year), and other supporting information are available in the PUF User Guides. The data files are made available in a delimited text, SAS, and       SPSS file type."

The American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database covers millions of surgical cases from 2006 onwards and has been increasingly used in all surgical fields given its validity and consistency in its data.
